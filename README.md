# The Youkai Pound
The repository for everyone's favorite TF2 server.

These plugins are very specific and are shared for the sake of letting anyone look at them. There are custom attributes written in the weaponreverts.sp file (recoil jumping, Team Fortress 2 classic features, holster reload) or other calculations within the server which may be of interest. You can also view the CWX config (https://github.com/nosoop/SM-TFCustomWeaponsX) in the configs directory.
The dependencies for these plugins are listed at the top in the include sections, but I wasn't able to recover Chdata's AddPlayerHealth stocks anywhere online, so I uploaded it to the include directory.
Requirements for the weapons plugin include: TF2Items, TF2 Attributes, Sourcescramble (https://github.com/nosoop/SMExt-SourceScramble), AddPlayerHealth by Chdata, tf custom attribtes (https://github.com/nosoop/SM-TFCustAttr)

Detectgamemode/DGM is always a WIP and will eventually include scrambling and balancing to manage things the way I would like.
